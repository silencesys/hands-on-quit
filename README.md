# 📜 The Creative Scriptorium

This is an app prototype developed during the 2019 [Hands:On hackathon](https://projects.history.qmul.ac.uk/handson/) in Cambridge by team QUIT. It is intended to be used on iPads as
a learning app for primary school children. It was designed as a prototype of the application that could accompany the upcoming palimpsest exhibition at the Cambridge University Library. It can be used in any scenario where it is necessary to explain what a manuscript and palimpsest is to who have not come in contact with any.

Preview of the prototype is available at [quit.silencesys.dev](https://quit.silencesys.dev).
